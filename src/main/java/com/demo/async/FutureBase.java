     Executors, Executor and ExecutorService
     1. The Executor and ExecutorService interfaces are used to work with different thread pool implementations in Java.
     2. you should keep your code decoupled from the actual implementation of the thread pool


     Notes:
     The Executor interface has a single execute method to submit Runnable instances for execution
     The ExecutorService interface contains a large number of methods for controlling the progress of the tasks and managing the termination of the service.

     ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor extends the ThreadPoolExecutor

     Runnableâ€˜s single method does not throw an exception and does not return value.
     Callable interface may be more convenient, as it allows to throw an exception and return a value.
