This setup demonstrates handling concurrent requests with a limit and simulating an interruption for an urgent request.

## Dummy HTTP Server:
The server uses a Semaphore to limit the number of concurrent requests to 5.
Each request handler sleeps for 5 seconds to simulate a long-running task.
If a request is interrupted, it sends a 500 response.


## Client with ThreadPool:
The client uses a thread pool with 5 threads to send requests to the server.
An additional urgent request (T6) is sent after a short delay.
The thread pool is then shut down to simulate interrupting the existing requests.
