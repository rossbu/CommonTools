## ReentrantLock and synchronized are examples of mutexes in Java.

Mutexes are used to protect shared resources from being accessed by multiple threads at the same time. In Java, the `synchronized` keyword and the `ReentrantLock` class are examples of mutexes.

reentrant locks  provide one lock per object, isn't it always a better idea to prefer a reentrant lock to a binary semaphore?

## Small differences between Semaphore and reenterant lock.

Semaphore may be released by another thread. Semaphore's javadoc states that such behavior may be useful in some specialized contexts like deadlock recovery. So it should be a really specialized contexts.
Also binary semaphores are not reenterant. You cannot acquire a binary semaphore second time in a same thread. It will lead to a deadlock (deadlocking thread with itself!) and you may need some means of already mentioned deadlock recovery
